# AI vs. Manual Code Comparison: Data Analysis

This project performs a comparative analysis of data processing and visualization using two different Python stacks. It also includes a case study comparing manually written code against AI-generated solutions.

## 📊 Project Scope
- **Datasets:** US Avocado Prices and Student Exam Performance.
- **Manual Implementation:** Using `Pandas` and `Seaborn`.
- **Advanced Implementation:** Using `Polars` (Lazy evaluation) and `Altair` (Declarative visualization).
- **ETL:** Data transformation and loading into `SQLite3` using the `PETL` library.

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `/scripts`: Python scripts for data analysis and plotting.
- `/data`: Source CSV files.
- `/docs`: Comparison report detailing AI vs. Manual coding performance.

## 🛠️ Requirements
To run these scripts, you will need:
```bash
pip install pandas polars altair seaborn petl vegafusion
